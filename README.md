# Hi, I'm Christian Weber 👋

**AI-Native Cloud Architecture for Seed–Series C SaaS**

I help companies and CTOs/VPs design cloud-agnostic, security-first platform foundations that enable engineering teams to move faster, scale reliably, and stay cost-efficient.

> 15+ years across public sector, automotive, assurance, IT, and SaaS. I am building system infrastructure that powers organisations at scale and architecting cloud platforms that accelerate engineering velocity and unlock growth.
> 
> My experience includes platforms supporting 2,500+ developers, autonomous driving systems at massive scale, and AWS Global Partner Award-winning infrastructure.


# 🚀 What I Do

My focus is designing, optimizing and scaling cloud-agnostic, security-first platforms that give engineering teams clarity, speed, and cost predictability. I provide architecture leadership for SaaS companies building or scaling AI-powered products.

**Working together:**
- Full-time assignment
- Architecture assessments revealing what's blocking velocity and reliability
- Platform design blueprints your engineers can execute independently
- Hands-on guidance through implementation with reviews, decisions, unblocking
- Continuous advisory keeping your architecture ahead of growth, not catching up to it
- Agile team leadership driving your team with passion, structure and with swarm intelligence


# 🏗️ Core Expertise

**Cloud-Agnostic Platform Architecture**
- AWS, Azure, GCP — cloud selection driven by business fit, not lock-in
- Scalable platform design from prototype to Series B+
- Infrastructure that supports thousands of engineers without bottlenecks

**AI-Native Systems**
- Platform foundations for AI-powered SaaS products
- Scalable orchestration of AI workflows
- Cost-effective inference and training infrastructure

**Reliability & Security**
- Security-first architecture design
- Platform reliability frameworks
- Cost architecture aligned to business metrics

**Developer Experience**
- Self-service infrastructure enabling team autonomy
- Infrastructure-as-Code (Terraform, CDK, AWS Amplify)
- CI/CD and platform automation reducing operational friction

# 🤖 AI-Native Platform Enablement

Experience enabling infrastructure and platforms supporting AI-native workloads and automation systems.

- Cloud infrastructure supporting AI-enabled SaaS platforms
- Workflow automation using AI tools and Cloud-native services
- Architecture design enabling scalable AI integration
- Platform foundations supporting AI-native system evolution


# 🏆 Experience Highlights

- **Public Sector (2013–2016)**: Cloud Infrastructure Architect. Designed secure, compliant cloud infrastructure where security is structural and decisions carry long-term institutional weight.

- **AWS Partner — Automotive (2016–2019)**: Cloud Platform Architect — Autonomous Driving. Enabled 1,700 engineers across distributed teams with extreme data processing at speed under strict compliance. **AWS Global Partner Award** for outstanding cloud platform delivery.

- **Capgemini (2019–2022)**: Principal Cloud Architect — Global Platforms. Architected Azure Kubernetes platforms supporting 2,500+ developers across global engineering organisations. Co-authored executive architecture guidance on scalable Kubernetes and microservice platform design — published in collaboration with Microsoft.

- **MaCh2.Cloud (2022–Present)**: Principal AI-Native Cloud Architect. Fractional architecture leadership for Seed–Series C SaaS companies building or scaling AI-powered products. Creator of WAF2p — open-source extension of the Well-Architected Framework for AI-native, cloud-agnostic platform design.

- **FoxBase (2023–2024)**: Tech Team Lead & Co-Innovation Manager. Led AWS Amplify Backend-as-a-Service rollout for SaaS platform — deliberately trading low-level infrastructure control for faster time-to-market and improved developer experience. Architected platform foundation enabling rapid feature delivery across five countries while maintaining scalability for enterprise customers.


# 🎯 Philosophy

Architecture is not just infrastructure. It's the foundation that enables engineering teams to move faster and systems to scale reliably.

Your platform should outlast your roadmap. That means building foundations today that scale with your business tomorrow—not requiring a costly rewrite at growth stage.

I work with CTOs and engineering leaders to ensure architecture decisions are intentional, not accidental. Every constraint has a reason. Every trade-off is deliberate.
