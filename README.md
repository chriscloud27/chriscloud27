# Hi, I'm Christian Weber 👋

Product & Cloud Platform Leader with 13+ years designing and running scalable environments across on‑prem, AWS, and Azure.
I build Kubernetes and Terraform‑driven platforms, automate CI/CD, and increasingly use AI and workflow engines like n8n to remove toil.

- Automating infrastructure with Kubernetes, Docker, Terraform, GitHub/GitLab CI, Jenkins, Ansible, and Packer.
- Orchestrating AI‑powered workflows (OpenAI, Gemini, Claude, Copilot, vector stores) using n8n and custom scripts.
