# Hi, I'm Christian Weber 👋

Product & Cloud Platform Leader with 13+ years designing and running scalable environments across on‑prem, AWS, and Azure.[file:51]  
I build Kubernetes and Terraform‑driven platforms, automate CI/CD, and increasingly use AI and workflow engines like n8n to remove toil.[file:51]

## What I’m working on

- Designing cloud platforms for SaaS and enterprise customers (Azure AKS, AWS EC2/S3/ALB, IAM, GuardDuty, Defender).[file:51]  
- Automating infrastructure with Kubernetes, Docker, Terraform, GitHub/GitLab CI, Jenkins, Ansible, and Packer.[file:51]  
- Orchestrating AI‑powered workflows (OpenAI, Gemini, Claude, Copilot, vector stores) using n8n and custom scripts.[file:51]

## Tech I use a lot

**Cloud & Hosting**

- Azure (VM, AKS, AAD/Entra, Defender)  
- AWS (EC2, S3, ALB/NLB, IAM, GuardDuty)  
- Linux, on‑premise & VPS hosting[file:51]  

**DevOps & Automation**

- Kubernetes, Docker  
- Terraform, GitHub/GitLab CI, Jenkins  
- Ansible, Packer[file:51]  

**AI & Automation**

- OpenAI, Gemini, Claude, GitHub Copilot  
- n8n orchestration, prompt engineering, vector stores[file:51]  

**Monitoring**

- ELK Stack  
- AWS / Azure Monitoring  
- SolarWinds[file:51]

## How I think about architecture

I lean on proven frameworks like IBM Architectural Thinking, AWS/Azure Well‑Architected, Cloud Adoption Frameworks, 6R Migration Strategies, TOGAF, ITIL, ARC42, and the 12‑Factor app principles.[file:51]  
Most of my work combines these with practical constraints: cost, security, reliability, and speed of delivery.

## Selected experience (high level)

- Built a global Kubernetes platform on Azure with Terraform and GitOps, improving provisioning time by 90% and hardening container security.[file:51]  
- Led platform automation on a 90% automated AWS environment using CDK Python, supporting large enterprise workloads.[file:51]  
- Implemented automation and cloud hosting optimizations at a major German health insurer, affecting 8.5M+ customers.[file:51]
