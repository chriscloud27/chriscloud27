# Doing:Positioning (short to long-term)

Principal AI-Native Platform Architect for SaaS

I help SaaS companies design and build scalable AI-native Cloud platforms, enabling engineering teams to ship faster, scale reliably, and support long-term business growth.

# Solopreneur Path

**GCP Cloud Arch + CKA + IaC + WAF2p = CNCF-adjacent authority path for cloud-native thought leadership.**

💡

Deep Cloud Infra know-how → hands-on current projects → governed AI-acceleration → certifications + community and customer recognition → global authority

</aside>

## Authority Path

1. **Certs Foundation:** GCP teaches AI patterns; CKA validates K8s/IaC—prereqs for CNCF contribs.
2. **IaC Bridge:** Terraform modules for GCP/K8s → public GitHub, CNCF-compatible.
3. **WAF2p as CNCF Shard:**
    - Aligns with CNCF landscape (Cilium/OPA security, Prometheus reliability).
    - Submit Sandbox: Extends WAFs to K8s-native.
    - Contribs: Docs/PRs to Kubernetes sig-arch, landscape submission.

## Global Recognition

- **CNCF Visibility:** KubeCon talks ("WAF2p: Agnostic Resilience")—300k+ network.
- **Proof Loop:** Certs → IaC repos → WAF2p PRs → CNCF badge → SaaS clients.
- **Sub-niche Win:** "Cloud-agnostic WAF for AI-SaaS" fills gap; CNCF TAC endorsement.

**Cloud AI Architect Cert and Comparison (2026)**

| **Cert** | **Decision** | **Study Time** | **Cost (USD)** | **Cred Increase (1-10)** | **Ease of Pass (1-10, 10=easy)** | **Validity** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **AWS Sol Arch Pro** |  | 3-6 mo | $300 | 10 (S-tier, jobs gold) | 4 (toughest pro) | 3 yrs |
| **GCP Cloud Arch** | #1 | 2-4 mo | $200 | 9 (high salary) | 7 (easier pro) | 2 yrs |
| **Azure AZ-305** |  | 3-5 mo | $165 | 8 (enterprise) | 5 (tricky) | 1 yr (renew) |
| **GCP ML Eng** |  | 2-4 mo | $200 | 9 (AI demand) | 6 (niche hard) | 2 yrs |
| **AWS ML Specialty** |  | 3-5 mo | $300 | 9 (AI scale) | 5 (specialty tough) | 3 yrs |
| **CKA** | #2 | 2-3 mo | $445 | 10 (gold standard) | 3 (66% pass, labs) | 2-3 yrs |
| **MS Agentic AI** |  | 2-4 mo | $165 | 7 (new/emerging) | 6 (beta) | 1 yr |

**→ Top Stack: GCP Cloud Arch + CKA-**agnostic AI-SaaS authority.

## IaC in SaaS Summary

**IaC is foundational for SaaS.** Codes multi-tenant infra, enables agnostic scaling, zero-downtime deploys.

## SaaS Applications

- **Multi-tenancy:** Code isolated namespaces (Kubernetes via Terraform) for 1000s users.
- **Cloud-agnostic:** Single Terraform repo switches AWS→GCP—your headline sweet spot.
- **AI Integration:** IaC deploys SageMaker/Vertex endpoints + monitoring; drift detection prevents outages.
- **Scale-up Wins:** 60% faster deploys, 50% fewer errors; self-service envs for teams.
